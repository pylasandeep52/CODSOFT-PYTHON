# CODSOFT-PYTHON
I have completed 5 tasks of codsoft intern i.e  to-do-list, simple calculator, password generator, weather forecast and quiz game applications.

TASK 1: TO-DO-LIST APPLICATION

In this application users can add new tasks with descriptions, due dates, and priority levels. They can view their tasks in a list, mark 
tasks as completed, and delete tasks when they are done with them. The data is saved and loaded from the todo_data.json file using the 
save_data and load_data functions. In this application we can perform add, remove, update, mark it as completed, sort by date and sort by 
priority features and it user-friendly application.

TASK 2: CALCULATOR APPLICATION

In this application it creates a simple mobile calculator with a user-friendly interface. The calculator performs basic arithmetic 
operations and can handle decimal numbers. It includes a clear button ('C') to reset the display, an equal button ('=') to evaluate the 
expression, and buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator has a clean and responsive design, making
it suitable for a mobile-like experience.

TASK 3: PASSWORD GENERATOR

In this application, the user can input the desired password length and then click the "Generate Password" button to generate a random 
password containing letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and special characters. The generated password will be displayed in
an entry field. The application checks if the password length is at least 8 characters, and if not, it shows a warning message to the 
user. Otherwise, it proceeds to generate the password.

TASK 4: WEATHER FORECAST APPLICATION

In this application I developED  a weather forecast application using python  this project will involve retrieving weather data from an 
API and presenting in a user friendly format. Prompt the user to enter the name of the city and a zip code. extract relevant weather
information such as temperature, humidity, and description from the API resource. Finally it will display the retrieved weather information to the user in a user friendy format

TASK 5: QUIZ GAME APPLICATION

The quiz game application is developed using a GUI interface. It displays a welcome message and rules at the beginning, and users can 
start the quiz by clicking the "Start Quiz" button. The questions are displayed one by one, and the user can choose an answer for each 
question. The user's score is tracked, and the performance message is shown at the end of the quiz. After completing the quiz, the user 
can choose to play again by clicking the "Play Again" button.
